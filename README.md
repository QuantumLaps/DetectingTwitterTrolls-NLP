### **Detecting Twitter Trolls using NLP by training on Message Bodies**
The social media has seen a rapid growth in the last few decades. This has led to rise in the internet trolls and are gaining much more influence.

A troll farm is a group of Internet trolls that get paid to spread certain opinions or information online.
Identifying a troll farm can be difficult, since the trolls try to stay hidden. Russian trolls effected social media opinion in the 2016 U.S presidential election.

A machine learning model can be built to identify these types of tweets and this would help us to know, if these are real people's opinion or are created to divert people's opinion.

Our work will include using various ML models such as :
- Support Vector Machines.
- Word2Vec and neural networks to find patterns in the tweets and classify them whether they are trolls or not and also determine which ML model gives the best accuracy.

*We will host the model once it is completed.*
